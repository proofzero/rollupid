## Galaxy GraphQL API Key

This key gives you access to [Galaxy](../galaxy/index.md)
where you can query all of your configured scopes (see the [Console Reference](reference.md)
for more information).

### Roll Keys

"Roll Keys" allows you to generate new keys and expire existing ones.

## 0xAuth Settings

**0xAuth** is our standard implementation of OAuth, extended to support decentralization.

This section shows your 0xAuth Application ID and Secret. Like in standard
OAuth, these are effectively your application's username and password for the
0xAuth authorization scheme.

0xAuth configuration is covered in the [Console Reference](reference.md).

### Roll Keys

"Roll Keys" allows you to generate a new secret and expire an existing one.

## Smart Contracts and Logins

Connect smart contracts to your 3ID application to import the account addresses
of token holders. Owners of these accounts who connect to your 3ID application
will be shown under "Logins".
